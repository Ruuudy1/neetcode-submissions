# this is the continuation of a leetcode easy problem "Merge 2 Lists"
# we can divide and conquer and break this problem down into the "Merge 2 Lists" problem
# reducing the runtime from O(n*k) to O(nlogk) by dividing 
# n: the number of lists 
# k: the number of times we have to go through each merged list
